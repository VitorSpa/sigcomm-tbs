# A Quantitative Analysis Tool for Bottleneck-Aware Network Design in Distributed AI Training

## Introduction

This demonstration presents **BotAI**, a bottleneck-aware network design tool optimized for distributed AI training workloads. 
Leveraging Bottleneck Structure Theory (BST), **BotAI** produces an efficient, wasteless network configuration tailored to a given topology and system setup. 
It ensures that all data flows complete simultaneously, no bandwidth is wasted, and throughput is maximizedâ€”achieving peak performance at a fixed cost. 
This optimized design serves as a robust performance baseline before considering any overprovisioning strategies.
